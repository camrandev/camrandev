ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a full-stack software engineer, with expertise in both JS/TS (React, Svelte/Kit) and Python (Django, Flask)
ðŸ‘¯ I am actively looking for full-time roles. I am also very open to additional contract work. 

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me: crynowecer11@gmail.com.

âš¡ Outside of building things, I love to cook, travel, and stay active. I recently started to take running seriously, and completed my first marathon in Tokyo!

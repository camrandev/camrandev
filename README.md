ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a full-stack software engineer, with a high level of comfort in both Javascript and Python-based stacks. On my current project, I am building an MVP for a stealth startup in the logistics space. The MVP consists of a React client and Flask API. The project is being deployed using AWS Amplify for the client, and AWS Lightsail for the API. Previously, I worked primarily on the backend with Python and Django on a flexible enterprise LMS platform.

ðŸ‘¯ I am actively looking for full-time roles. I am also very open to additional contract work. 

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me: crynowecer11@gmail.com.

âš¡ Outside of building things, I love to cook, travel, and stay active. I recently started to take running seriously, and completed my first marathon in Tokyo!

### Hello! I am Camran and I am based in Boston, MA.

## Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and am open to working remotely or in person as a software engineer. I am also open to contract work in certain situations.

## Ask me about my experience working on the customer-facing side of the SaaS industry, and how that informs my approach to software development.

## Feel free to reach me: camran.dev@gmail.com.
